🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview
This project aims to build a full-stack application that predicts the price of a house based on user inputs such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and location. It integrates a machine learning model (trained using Python and scikit-learn) with a modern web frontend built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can enter property details through the interactive UI, and the app communicates with a backend server (Flask or Django) to return the predicted house price in real-time.The goal is to demonstrate the synergy of data science and web development by deploying an end-to-end predictive model in a user-friendly application.
