**🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning**

**📌 Project Overview**

This project aims to build a full-stack application that predicts the price of a house based on user inputs such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and location. It integrates a machine learning model (trained using Python and scikit-learn) with a modern web frontend built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can enter property details through the interactive UI, and the app communicates with a backend server (Flask) to return the predicted house price in real-time.The goal is to demonstrate the synergy of data science and web development by deploying an end-to-end predictive model in a user-friendly application.

**🚀 Features**
Predict house prices based on user input.
Trained ML model using regression techniques.
User-friendly web interface (optional - Flask/Django).
Data visualization of important features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and preprocessing.
Model performance metrics (R² Score, MAE, MSE, RMSE).
